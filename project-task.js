Objective:
Students will create a custom calculator using JavaScript's Math module to perform
a series of mathematical operations. This activity will help them practice and
understand how to combine and use various Math methods for common operations.



Instructions:
Scenario:
You are building a calculator for an online math game.
The calculator must include functionality to perform the following:
  Absolute Value Calculation: Given any number, return its absolute value.
  
  Power Calculation: Calculate and return the value of a base raised to a specific power.
  
  Square Root Finder: Calculate the square root of a number.
  
  Maximum and Minimum Finder: From a given set of numbers, determine the largest and smallest values.
  
  Random Number Generator: Generate a random integer within a specified range.
  
  Custom Rounding: Round a number to a specified number of decimal places.



Step-by-Step Tasks:
  Write a function for each operation listed above using the Math module.
  
  Test each function with sample inputs to ensure it works as intended.
  
  Combine the individual functions into a single "calculator" program where the user can select an operation and input the required values.



  Scenarios for Students:
  Find the absolute value of -45.67.
  
  Raise 5 to the power of 3.
  
  Calculate the square root of 144.
  
  Determine the largest and smallest values from [3, 78, -12, 0.5, 27].
  
  Generate a random number between 1 and 50.
  
  Round 23.67891 to 2 decimal places.
