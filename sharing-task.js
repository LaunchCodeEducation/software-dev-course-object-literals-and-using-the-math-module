/*
Objective:
Students will collaboratively create a library of object literals representing a theme of their choice
(e.g., a library of animals, cars, recipes, or planets). The activity encourages teamwork, creativity,
and knowledge sharing while practicing how to create, use, and manipulate object literals in JavaScript.



Instructions:

Step 1: Form Small Groups
  Divide students into small groups (3–4 members each). Each group will collaboratively work on a specific
  category of object literals (e.g., "Animals," "Vehicles," "Fruits").

Step 2: Define the Structure
  Each group must agree on a consistent structure for their objects. For example, if the theme is
  "Animals," the structure might include properties like name, species, diet, habitat, and endangeredStatus.

Example Object Structure (Theme: Animals):
{
  name: "Elephant",
  species: "African Elephant",
  diet: "Herbivore",
  habitat: "Savanna",
  endangeredStatus: "Vulnerable"
}

Step 3: Create the Objects
  Each member of the group will create 2–3 unique objects following the agreed structure. The group will
  combine these objects into a shared library, which will be stored in an array.

Step 4: Share and Query
  Groups will:
    Share their library with another group.
    Write and run JavaScript code to interact with the other group’s library. For example:
    Find an object with a specific property value (e.g., all animals with diet set to "Carnivore").
    Add a new object to the library.
    Modify an existing object in the library.
    Delete an object from the library based on a condition.

Step 5: Present and Discuss
  Each group presents their library and shares examples of how they queried or modified another
  group’s objects. This encourages cross-group learning and feedback.
